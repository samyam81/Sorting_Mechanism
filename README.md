# Sorting Mechanisms Repository

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Below are the details of each sorting mechanism along with their respective implementations.

## Bogo Sort (Java)

A highly inefficient sorting algorithm that generates random permutations of the input array until it is sorted.

## Insertion Sort (Java)

A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Miracle Sort (Java)

An ironic sorting algorithm that does nothing and hopes the array is already sorted.

## Quick Sort (C++)

A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer strategy by recursively partitioning the array.

## Remove Unsorted (Java)

A method to remove duplicates from an unsorted array using HashSet.

## Bubble Sort (C++)

A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Bubble Sort (C#)

A simple sorting algorithm implemented in C#.
